# Minimum Spanning Tree

In electrical circuit design, usually there are several components need to be connected by their pins. Hopefully, using n-1 wires could connect n pins and with the total length of wires the least. In other words, a acyclic connected component is to be found from an undirected graph, resulting in a **Minimum Spanning Tree** in the end.

Generally, there are two types of algorithms try to solve the problem and in two distinct ways, both employ the concept of [greedy algorithms](../greedy-algorithms/overview.md)
