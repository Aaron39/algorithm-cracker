a formal mathematical foundation.\nWhy Analyzing Algorithms?\nTo optimize the performance during the process from inputs to outputs. To become a better Software/Hardware developer in any fields of computer science. Improve your analytical thinking with programming abilities and many more.\nA quote from The Design and Analysis of Algorithms, 1974, that:\n\nPerhaps the most important principle for the good algorithm designer is to refuse to be content.\n\nUpon leaving the note above, we know that constant assessments and improvements are required for the algorithm designers to advance their goals in research or work.\nNote: algorithm itself is programming language-agnostic and the pseudocode is a communicative tool for algorithm's descriptive purposes.\nMachine Model\nResources (memory, CPU and disk spaces) are what we take into account as analyzing the algorithms are ongoing and most of the time we care about the running time of a piece of program in a general purpose computing machine and a generalized model comes into play.\nRAM (Random Access Machine) with a single core and execute one instruction a time is a proper model for analyzing algorithms. And it will bypass the hierarchy modeling of common memory/cache of real computers for analysis simplicity.\nFactors of Algorithm Analysis\nTo devise a FAST algorithm in specific context, we should be expecting a slow growth of the worst-case running time with the input size, and it gives rise to a corresponding Big-Oh interpretation.\nWorst-Case\nWhy do we care about worst-case scenario?\n\nWorst-case running time provides an absolute uppper bound given the input size n, no even worse case could happen.\nWorst-case often happens. For instance, a special entry of info is missing upon database querying, then query process takes the worst-case running time.\nAverage-Case usually performs as much bad as the Worst-Case: given an array with random numbers, how long it takes to determine the place of A[1..j-1] to insert A[j] into? In average, half of A[1..j-1] less than A[j] and half larger than A[j], thus the comparison time reduces by 2 but the resulting average-case running time still is a proportion of a quadratic function.\n\nAverage-Case\nIt is useful though rare for the average-case scenario comes into play. E.g. In situations where we require statistical, probability analysis and randomized algorithms.\nAsymptotic Notations\nAsymptotic analysis is a Sweet Spot for high-level reasoning about algorithms and a good enough technique to suppress details of less important Resources such as computer architecture, language spec and compiler implementations.\nIt is designed to focus on understanding large-scale problems for its nature in addressing a \"asymptotic\" alike representations. For instance, the mathematical Big-Oh notation helps describe how algorithm running time grows with input size approximating to Infinity; likewise, it could also formalize approximately how many possible connected edges there are given a fixed number of vertices of a graph structure.\nNote: suppress constant factors (too system dependent) and lower-order terms (irrelevant terms for large inputs) are the best practices in analysis\nBig-Oh Notation\nBig-Oh Notation is the most commonly used asymptotic notations since most of the time we care about the upper bound, in other words, the worst-case of the algorithm running time.\nFormal Def:\nΤ(n) = Ο(ƒ(n))\niff ∃ с,n0\nsuch that Τ(n) ⩽ с ⋅ ƒ(n) for ∀ n ⩾ n0\nBig-Omega Notation\nBig-Omega often describes the best case running time given the algorithm but normally we care the least of it during the analysis process.\nFormal Def:\nΤ(n) = Ω(ƒ(n)) iff\n∃ с,n0\nsuch that\nΤ(n) ⩾ с ⋅ ƒ(n) for ∀ n ⩾ n0\nBig-Theta Notation\nBig-Theta serves as a supplement to the Big-Oh for an exhaustive prediction in terms of algorithm analysis.\nFormal Def: Τ(n) = Θ(ƒ(n)) iff Τ(n) = Ο(ƒ(n)) and Τ(n) = Ω(ƒ(n))\nIt is a common error to use Ο instead of Θ to denote the Τ(n) for specific algorithms.

The grade-school integer multiplication algorithm\n\n\nIn this naive algorithm, the total number of operations is 3 (3 operations per row for multiplication and addition)· 3 (3 rows in total) = 9.

After applying Karatsuba multiplication the overall complexity would be Τ(n) = 3 Τ(n / 2) + Ο(n) = Ο(nlog23) ≈ Ο(n1.59).\nHence, the Karatsuba multiplication beats the naive integer multiplication algorithm in their running time efficiency.\n\nMatrix Multiplication\nMatrix Multiplication, termed as Matrix dot Product as well, is a form of multiplication involving two matrices Χ (n ✗ n), Υ (n ✗ n)like below:\n\n  \n  Figure 2.

The first one is suitable for education for its simplicity while the second one has a slightly better performance and widely adopted in many libraries.\nTop-down Approach\nIt is a common practice to use such a recursive approach:\nTOP_DOWN_MERGE_SORT(array, low, high, new_array)\n  if high - low Bottom-up Approach\nrather than a recursive method in above approach, using a iterative method:\nBOTTOM_UP_MERGE_SORT(array, new_array)\n  for width := 1, width and the universal MERGE step:\nMERGE(array, low, middle, high, new_array)\n  i := low\n  j := middle\n  for k in range (high - low)\n    if i Algorithm Analysis\nMergeSort is a stable sorting scheme that has average and worst-case running times of Ο(n ⋅ log(n)) regardless of the inputs.\nIt is simple to prove the running complexity by master method Τ(n) = 2 Τ(n/2) + Θ(n)\nAdditional References\n\nCombining MergeSort and InsertionSort: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/68179/combining-merge-sort-and-insertion-sort\n\n"},"sorting/heap-sort.html":{"url":"sorting/heap-sort.html","title":"Heap Sort","keywords":"","body":"Heap Sort\nBased on a typical heap data structure, Heap Sort is an in-place, not stable comparison-baed sorting algorithm and can be thought of as a improved version of selection sort algorithm.\nFundamental Ideas\nInitially, a BUILD-MAX-HEAP is called upon a randomly distributed inputs to setup a max-heap.

It applies to all recursive calls with all sub-arrays until the base case in order that all elements are sorted in place.\nUnlike the Merge Sort, Quick Sort is implemented in a style of sort-in-place with little extra memory usage. Quick Sort is prevalent in many practical applications and its average-case running time Ο(n ⋅ log n) equates many of existing performant comparison-based implementations like MergeSort.\nDifferent partition methods incur distinct expected running time in total.

It is vital for many computer science problems and worth attention for not only theoretical studies but also practical application development.\nThis chapter discusses fundamental graph structures, typical graph problems and correlated algorithm analysis. Specifically, graph searching primitives such as DFS and BFS are the most important techniques throughout the graph algorithms.\nGraph Definitions\nGenerally, there are two kinds of graphs: directed graph and undirected graph. Both of them involve a relationship between Vertex V and Edge E.\nDirected Graph\nGiven a graph G = (V, E), wherein the V is a set of vertices of G and E is a set of edges going in and out from vertices with directions, connected them together. Specifically, given vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, a graph can be built like below:\n\n  \n  Figure 1. Directed Graph\n\n\nNote: there are cycles (even self cycles, a vertex points to itself) in directed graphs and to be noted that problems like topological sort could not have solutions if cycles present, the directed graph with no cycles is called DAG (directed acyclic graph).\nUndirected Graph\nUnlike directed graph, undirected graph only has edges with no directions between connected vertices. Since the relations among vertices have no ordering, there exists no self cycles. Similarly,\n\n  \n  Figure 2. Undirected Graph\n\n\nDegrees\nIn an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex means the number of edges associated with that vertex. For instance, the degree of vertex 3 in the above graph is 3;\nWhile in the directed graph, the degree of a vertex is the summation of its in-degree and out-degree. Such in-degree means the number of edges pointing towards the vertex and out-degree means the number of edges pointing out of the vertex.\nNote: the vertex with zero degree means it is a lonely island, disconnected from any other vertices in the graph.\nConnectivity\nIf for any given vertices in an undirected graph, there exists paths reachable from all other vertices, then the graph is connected. Specifically, if an undirected graph G = (V, E) is connected, the number of edges is larger than or equal to number of vertices minus 1: |E| ≥ |V| - 1.\nThere are only definitions of strongly connected and weakly connected in a directed graph. In a strongly connected directed graph G = (V, E), for any two distinct vertices x, y within V, there exists paths from x to y and from y to x;\nSubstituting all directional edges of a directed graph with undirected ones could obtain a base graph of the original graph. If such a base graph is connected, then the original directed graph is weakly connected.\nGraph Representations\nTwo vertices sharing a same edge are adjacent in a graph. To define such relationships among vertices, two practical uses of data structures are introduced: adjacency matrix and adjacency list.\nAdjacency Matrix\nThis matrix (e.g. adj[][]) is a 2D array with size |V| ✗ |V|; In an undirected graph, if vertex a and vertex b are connected, then adj[a][b] = 1 and adj[b][a] = 1; if there are no edges between say vertex e and vertex c, then adj[e][c] = 0, adj[c][e] = 0;\nFor a directed graph, the matrix cell value depends on the existance of directional edges; If vertex a has an edge going outward to vertex b while vertex b has no edges going inward to vertex a, then adj[a][b] = 1 but adj[b][a] = 0\n\n  \n  Figure 3. Adjacency Matrices of a Directed Graph and an Undirected Graph\n\n\nAdjacency matrix is practical when the graph is dense (at least one edge going in between two vertices) and finding the existence of edges is immediate (LOOKUP costs Ο(1)). It is less so if the graph is sparse (the graph topology structure approaches a forest rather than a graph).\nAdjacency List\nAdjacency list is an array of linkedlist in design and it costs only Ο(|V| + |E|) compared to adjacency matrix. In addition, the array can be dynamic which means adding vertices to a graph is easier than a static structure like adjacency matrix.\n\n  \n  Figure 4.

In the original version of Dijkstra's algorithm, it only tries to find the minimal path between two nodes, but more commonly the modern variant can find the shortest paths from a single source\nto all other nodes, producing a shortest path tree.\nSpecifically, for each edge (u, v) in a non-negative weighted graph G, maintain a set S of vertices whose final shortest paths have been computed.

Before diving into the details of B-tree operations, it is important to first understand differences between disk-based data structures and memory-based ones.\nDisk-based Data Structures\nIn the present, there are two major types of secondary storage: Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD), both of which have random access speed considerably slower than RAM. (see: here). Despite of the fact that SSD is much faster than HDD in terms of access speed, costs of SSD per GB is much more than that of the HDD.\nThen, the computer I/O model can be approximated as the following picture, where the secondary storage access has time is much higher than main memory and CPU:\n\n  \n  Figure 1. A Simplified Computer I/O Model\n\n\nAnd since the majority of data items are not stored in the memory, it is critical to have fewer I/O access to the disk drives to save as much time as possible. The data structures in disk have to be made differently than in the main memory.\nHard Disk Drive\nA typical HDD will look like the following picture:\n\n  \n  Figure 2. Hard Disk Drive Internal Look\n\n\nIt consists of one or many platters which all spin around a common spindle. The drive moves a magnetic arm to read/write data from the underlying platters using its head. When the platters are spinning and the head remains still, the traveling trajectory of the head makes a circle called track, which is further divided into multiple sectors with equally distributed physical spaces for data read/write.\nNormally, there are three steps to access disk sectors: seek, latency and transfer.\n\nseek: the time it takes for the head to move to a relevant track.\nlatency: the round trip time for the platters to spin for a cycle under the same read/write head.\ntransfer: read/write operations on disk sectors.\n\nThe time costs ranking from high to low: seek > latency > transfer. And every I/O access requires physical address lookup on the disk and triggers operations of seek while platters are spinning and so forth. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the total number of times the disk I/O access is triggered, especially seek operations in between.\nLocality of Reference and pre-read\nIn addition to above, modern computers always pre-read data in advance rather than read by need. Even though sometimes we only read 1 byte, the system still retrieve some length of data into the memory. (see locality of reference) The pre-read data item normally spans as a multiple of page size (4k in many operating systems, as data exchange unit between disk and memory) along a relevant sector (which does not involve seek)\nFor a B-tree data structure, each node possesses a space of a multiple of page size (computers allocate _page_s side by side physically) to have a one time I/O guarantee with maximal data needed. Since the B-tree has a very large branching factor, it has far smaller height than normal BBSTs such as red-black tree, which means a key search in B-tree would require traversing far fewer nodes. As a indexing data structure in disk, B-tree is highly efficient than normal BBSTs.\nDefinition of B-tree\nA B-tree T with branching factor M is a rooted tree that has the following properties:\n\nEach node x has (up to) M - 1 keys and stored in non-descendent order that x.key1 ⩽ x.key2 ⩽ ... ⩽ x.keym-1.\n\nIn each node, there are M number of pointers to their children in between wherein each key will have a left pointer and a right pointer.\n\nKeys in a node split the ranges of their children's keys: e.g. there is a pointer between two adjacent keys 3 and 7, then the child node will have keys ranging from 3 to 7 exclusively.\n\nEach leaf node has the same depth, which is the height of the tree.\n\nDefine a constant minimum degree d (as the order of B-tree) to represent the minimum number of keys in a non-leaf node. (B-tree typically has d at least M/2)\n\n\nA graphical example with M = 4 (ignoring data items for convenience, in real implementations there are items associated with keys):\n\n  \n  Figure 3. A B-tree Example\n\n\nB+ Tree\nImagine there are frequent query requests sent to the database servers or file systems for specific data, some parts of indexes should stay in memory or cache to have better response time. B+ tree is more suitable than B-tree in this scenario.\nIn a B+ tree, all internal nodes have no data and only keys and ONLY leaves maintain all data items instead. In this way, one I/O access of a single page would retrieve a node with more indexes, therefore B+ tree is more disk-friendly (loading nodes into the memory without considering of varying data object sizes). Moreover, B+ tree is a threaded tree which means all its leaf nodes are connected and better for range query (e.g. search for a date range within the data)\n\n  \n  Figure 4.

Normally, the heap is referred as binary heap, theoretical tree-like, which could be stored in either a static or dynamic structure such as a static array, tree nodes.\nIt is mostly favored to use a static array structure given that INSERTION operations of new entries always happen in a row from left-side of the tree to the right-side of the tree, which means the heap structure is nearly a complete binary tree fully filled except the leaf level. Figuratively,\n\n  \n  Figure 1. Binary Heap in a Static Array Implementation\n\n\nNew elements will be promptly appended to the end of the array and entry removal only happens at the root. And these operations will incur the heap maintenance steps to ensure its status as a max-heap or min-heap\nNote: There are certain operations to take such as PARENT(i) = i/2, which is the index of node i's parent; LEFT(i) = 2i, which is the index of node i's left child; RIGHT(i) = 2i + 1, which is the index of node i's right child.\nMax Heap and Min Heap\nIn a max heap, the key of a node is larger than or equal to the keys of its children. The largest element is stored in root. Specifically, given an array A for entry storage:\nA[PARENT(i)] ⩾ A[i]\nSimilarly, a min heap will have keys of nodes are smaller than their children. The smallest entry is stored in root. Then,\nA[PARENT(i)] ⩽ A[i]\nIn a Heap Sort algorithm, the max heap is chosen while the min heap is generally common in building a priority queue.\nNote: only max heap data structure is used in further discussions.\nHeap Property Maintenance\nA MAX-HEAPIFY is a critical process for heap property maintenance. Given an array A and an index i, assuming LEFT(i) and RIGHT(i) are both max heap. Then, MAX-HEAPIFY is called upon if A[i] smaller than its children in order to adjust the position of A[i] in the total heap to maintain the overall max heap property.\nIt is worth noted that MAX-HEAPIFY operation should only be performed where a single heap property violation happens. In a top-down fashion,\n\n\nMAX_HEAPIFY(A, i)\n  l = left(i)\n  r = right(i)\n  if l ⩽ heap-size(A) and A[l] > A[i]\n    largest = l\n  else\n    largest = i\n  if r ⩽ heap-size(A) and A[r] > A[largest]\n    largest = r\n  if largest ≠ i\n    swap A[i] and A[largest]\n    MAX_HEAPIFY(A, largest)\n\n\n\nNote: recursive calls happen because after swapping the current index i entry with left or right child, the corresponding right or left sub-tree could have a new heap property violation.\nThe operations before each call of MAXHEAPIFY take constant time, and the total number of calls on MAX_HEAPIFY is bounded by Ο(_h), wherein h is the height of the heap. Therefore, the time complexity of MAX_HEAPIFY operation is Ο(log(n)) for a n-entry heap.\nBuild a Heap\nGiven an unordered inputs A stored in a static array structure, build a max heap from it involves iterative calls to MAX_HEAPIFY operation. Specifically,\nBUILD_MAX_HEAP(A)\n  for i = length(A)/2 to 1\n    MAX_HEAPIFY(A, i)\nwherein all leaves of the heap are between the index length(A)/2 + 1 to length(A). The overall process is a bottom-up fashion and generate the max heap regardless of the number of heap property violations.\nAlgorithm Analysis\nAt the bottom level of the heap, there are 2h nodes with each cost none for the heapify operation; at the level above the bottom, there are 2h-1 nodes with each cost most 1 swapping for the heapify operation, and so on. Figuratively,\n\n  \n  Figure 2. Build Max Heap Total Work\n\n\nThen, at the level j, there are 2h-j nodes with each cost most j swappings for the heapify operation. Counting them up,\n\n  \n\n\nBy infinite geometric series, the sum of j/2j converges to 2; thus,\nΤ(n) ⩽ 2h+1 = n + 1 = Ο(n)\nObviously, the operation must access each of the inputs during heap building and a more tighter bound will be Θ(n).\nAdditional References\n\nData Structures: Heaps. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Cq6tVNRBA\n\nLecture Notes: Heapsort analysis. http://www.cs.umd.edu/~meesh/351/mount/lectures/lect14-heapsort-analysis-part.pdf\n\n\n"},"tree/disjoint-set.html":{"url":"tree/disjoint-set.html","title":"Disjoint Set","keywords":"","body":"Disjoint Set\nThere are applications that requires manipulations on elements distributed on disjoint sets, e.g. Kruskal's Algorithm of generating a minimum spanning tree needs to manage disjoint forests during the construction of a tree.\nOperations\nA disjoint set data structure maintains a group of disjoint sets 풮 = {S1, S2, ..., Sk}; there is a leader element in each of the set to represent the set itself such that if no modifications made to a set between two set queries, the leader(s) for set representation remain the same.\nSpecifically, three operations are supported in disjoint set data structures:\n\nMAKE-SET(x): build a set with an only member x, which can not be contained in other sets.\nUNION(x, y): union the set 풮x (contains x) with the set 풮y (contains y) to form a new set; Since all the sets should be disjoint between any two of them, building a new set means eliminating the original sets 풮x and 풮y; Accordingly, the operation of DELETE-FROM-SET(x) is replaced by union an element of the original set with the new set.\nFIND-SET(x): return a pointer to a leader of a specific set.\n\nDynamic Connectivity\nIn a graph structure with myriad connected information in consistent alterations, computing the connectivity among the vertices play an important role in relevant studies. Such term provides a basis for the union-find algorithm, which is a widely practical algorithm in set related problems.\nUnion-Find\nIn the context of union-find operation, frequently there are UNION and FIND-SET involved. Algorithms described below provide conceptual solutions in different approaches, in which the last one is the most superior design.\nQuick Find\nUse a static array to map the elements occurrence: index as the key of an element and value as the set number such element belongs to. Then, if two elements are in the same set, they will share the same value and easy to find their equality in a array structure.\nFor instance, given an array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], if apply UNION(3, 4), which means connect element 3 to the set element 4 belongs to, which is 4; similarly, if UNION operation cause all of elements in one set have to change corresponding set number to another, it is a huge cost. To improve upon that, quick union is introduced.\nQuick Union\nInstead of making elements in the same sets have the same set number, this approach uses rooted tree (with root as the set leader) to connect all such elements. For instance, when applying UNION(3, 4) after element 4 is connected to element 9, a slight modification to make the element 3 the leaf of element 4 by changing the index number would suffice.\n\n  \n  Figure 1. Quick Union Example\n\n\nIn this way, the cost of UNION operation drastically decreases to Ο(1) while slightly increasing the FIND-SET(i) operation (array[array[array[...array[i]...]]]). However, the maximum height of such forest structure might be intimidating when there are numerous objects in a set, then an improvement mechanism is needed to balance the forest.\nQuick Union Improvement\n\nUnion By Rank\n\nPath Compression\n\n\n\n  \n  Figure 2.

The traverse method adopting Threaded Binary Tree is also called Morris Traversal.\nThat said, we do not need to allocate additional memory for each node in the tree.

It is a fundamental ability to search through the bulky data sets over the Internet for specified piece of information. Various of topics related to searching will be discussed further.\nSymbol Table\nAn abstract searching mechanism that a value entry is stored and later retrieved by a corresponding key is a symbol table, also known as dictionary. There are huge amount of keys and information for use in Internet and numerous applications such as symbol table in compiler design.\nThe main purpose of this data structure is to associate a value with a key and be able to search the value by its key. A formal definition of symbol table: a key-value pairs that supports two operations: Insert a pair into the table and Search for the value with a given key.\nTechnically, the keys are unique and duplicate keys may result in inconsistent searching operations. And values may collide with different associative keys such as two customers in a commercial database have the same DOB.\nNote: a symbol table is a conceptual structure that supports the searching operation and it indicates dynamic key-value pairs during such operation; if searching for a customer's name given his ID, the ID is the key, if searching for the ID of a customer given the name, the name is the key.\nGuidelines\nNoting that the symbol table could have key-value pairs in which key equals the value; the searching operation would return either one, multiple or no results and this operation takes advantage of the principle of symbol table.\nA plenty of data structures such as List, Array, Tree, Graph, Hash Table are built searching operation foundations. It is worth noted that List, often refers to LinkedList, is designed to have multiple containers of specific data objects connected to form a dynamic structure, while Array is a bulk of adjacent cells aligned in memory to form a static structure. (when locating ith element in Array structure, address(Array[i]) = address(Array[0]) + i * sizeof(Array object), thus it takes Ο(1) time)\nSearch Operations:\n\nSEARCH: find the specified element within the set of data.\nSELECT: locate the ith order statistic) within a possibly unordered set of data.\nMIN/MAX: find the minimum or maximum value among the values of the set of data.\nPREDECESSOR/SUCCESSOR: locate the immediate neighbors that are closest to the designated key in terms of values.

Whereas, performing INSERTION or DELETION operations in commonly seen sorted structures such as Array or List takes up to Ο(n) complexity; While a prevalent implementation that involves a concept of Tree, Binary Search Tree could boost the INSERTION and DELETION operations, meanwhile rapidly solve searching problems in a simple yet robust way.\nNote: If only demanding fast lookup operation in the algorithm design, the Hash Table would be better given its Ο(1) running time.\nPseudocode\nBINARY_SEARCH(array, start, end, target)\n  middle := (start + end) / 2\n  if array[middle] = target\n    return array[middle]\n  else if array[middle] > target\n    BINARY_SEARCH(array, start, middle - 1, target)\n  else if array[middle] \nBinary Search Tree (BST)\nBST is organized on the basis of a structure of binary tree and is a rooted tree; It could be represented in a dynamic list wherein the nodes contain information about pointer to the left, right and parent subtree.\n\n  \n  Figure 1. Binary Search Tree Graphical Representation\n\n\nThe design idea of BST is that given every possible node x in the tree, all keys in the left subtree are smaller than x while all keys in the right subtree are larger than x.\nTraversal of BST\nTraverse through an entire structure of BST recursively or iteratively has three distinct ways: in-order tree walk, pre-order tree walk and post-order tree walk.\n\nIn-order Tree Walk\n\nThe output key entries of sub-trees follows the pattern of left subtree, root and right subtree. e.g. the In-order Tree Walk of Figure 1 binary tree yields 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14.\n\nPre-order Tree Walk\n\nThe output key entries of sub-trees follows the pattern of root, left subtree and right subtree. e.g. the Pre-order Tree Walk of Figure 1 binary tree yields 8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13.\n\nPost-order Tree Walk\n\nThe output key entries of sub-trees follows the pattern of left subtree, right subtree and root. e.g. the Post-order Tree Walk of Figure 1 binary tree yields 1, 4, 7, 6, 3, 13, 14, 10, 8.\nSearching Performance\nBasic operations cost of a Binary Search Tree is proportional to the height of such tree. Given a randomly built binary search tree with n keys, it is expected to have a tree of height log(n) and the searching consumption is Θ(log n).\nIt requires a worst-case running time of Ο(n) if the arriving sequence of data is monotonically increasing or decreasing during the binary tree formation. Additionally, during the INSERTION or DELETION operations on the tree, there is possibility that properties of binary tree are violated. Therefore, it is necessary to form a tree structure with a relative balanced entry distribution called Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST), which means both sides of the tree or subtree have a relative same height. In order to maintain such property of BBST even during massive INSERTION or DELETION operations on the tree, a special Rotation operation comes into play.\nRotation\nRotations are called when the BBST properties are violated. There are two kinds of rotations: left rotation and right rotation; they both operate on the pointers among the nodes to maintain the balanced features of the tree.\n\nLeft Rotation\n\nThis method is called when (in AVL Tree, height difference between the right subtree and the left subtree is more than 1).\nAs shown in figure 2, left rotate operation can be formalized as LEFT-ROTATE(T, y), which transforms the right child of y to be the parent of y in the new tree and assigns the β child of x to y.\n\n\nLEFT_ROTATE(T, y)\n  x = y.right\n  y.right = x.left\n  if x.left ≠ null\n    x.left.parent = y\n  x.parent = y.parent\n  if y.parent == null\n    T.root = x\n  else if y == y.parent.left\n    y.parent.left = x\n  else\n    y.parent.right = x\n  x.left = y\n  y.parent = x\n\n\n\n\nRight Rotation\n\nThis method is called when (in AVL Tree, the height difference between the left subtree and the right subtree is more than 1).\nAs shown in figure 2, right rotate operation can be formalized as RIGHT-ROTATE(T, x), which transforms the left child of x to be the parent of x in the new tree and assigns the β child of y to x.\n\n\nRIGHT_ROTATE(T, x)\n  y = x.left\n  x.left = y.right\n  if y.right ≠ null\n    y.right.parent = x\n  y.parent = x.parent\n  if x.parent == null\n    T.root = y\n  else if x.parent.left = x\n    x.parent.left = y\n  else\n    x.parent.right = y\n  y.right = x\n  x.parent = y\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Figure 2.

In other words, the vertices are dynamically categorized into visited and unvisited sets during the search.\nBreadth-First Search\nConceptually, BFS is an algorithm to traverse for specific paths or locate entries in search tree or graph structures (directed or undirected graph); It starts with a source entry and visit its neighbors first before moving on to the next level neighbors, repeatedly until the target entry is reached. BFS has a wide application scenarios: web crawling, social networking, network broadcasting etc.\nBasically, BFS adopts a queue (First-In-First-Out) structure to store the forefront visited vertices to assist traversal in the next level.\nBREATH_FIRST_SEARCH(graph, source, target)\n\n  initialize visited_set, queue\n  visited_set.add(source)\n  queue.add(source)\n\n  while(!queue.is_empty())\n    vertex = queue.remove()\n\n    if(vertex == target)\n      return vertex\n    else\n      visited_set.add(vertex)\n\n      for unvisited_vertex of vertex\n        if(unvisited_vertex == target)\n          return vertex\n        else\n          visited_set.add(unvisited_vertex)\n          queue.add(unvisited_vertex)\n\n  return null\nThe BFS search produces a conceptual tree structure that could also facilitates the understandings of BFS search:\n\n  \n  Figure 1. An example Map of Germany with some connections between cities\n\n\n\n  \n  Figure 2. A tree obtained after BFS search starting from city Frankfurt\n\n\n\nAlgorithm Analysis\n\nTime complexity could be expressed as Ο(|V + E|), wherein E could be in the range Ο(1) ~ Ο(|V|2), depending on how sparse the graph is. BFS in general is a memory-based algorithm thus if the graphs are too large to store in memory, it is more practical to interpret the complexity differently: given the distance d (number of edge traversals) to search an entry starting from a node, BFS takes Ο(bd), where b is the average branching factor.\nBidirectional Search\nBidirectional Search aims to search for the target starting forwards from the starting entry and backwards from the end entry simultaneously. It is an overall better searching strategy than other forms of graph searching.\nThe reason bidirectional search outperforms the uni-search in any forms is that the search tree grows exponentially with search distance increases, therefore two smaller trees have fewer edges going outwards for searching. Technically, when the two searches come across, the time complexity would be Ο(2 * bd/2).\nNote: the bidirectional search is generally determined by other basic types of searches: BFS, Best-first and A*.\nDepth-First Search\nAs the name suggests, DFS is searching on a basis of depth while BFS is searching on a basis of breadth. DFS is a searching primitive that is designed to find entries in a search tree or graph structures. Specifically, it starts searching from the source and go as far as possible to the end of a branch before backtracking; Whenever there is match of target(s), DFS would end.\nThough DFS does not require complex data structures to assist searching task, it is recursive in nature that could consumes great amount of stack space. In the context of WEB, it is more favored to use BFS than DFS in searching.\nDEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH(graph, source, target)\n  for(unvisited_vertices of source)\n    if(unvisited_vertex_v == target)\n      return target\n    else\n      mark unvisited_vertex_v as visited\n      DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH(graph, v, target)\n\n  return null\n\nAlgorithm Analysis\n\nSame as BFS, the time complexity would be expressed as Ο(|V + E|). It consumes almost Ο(|V|) of stack space in the worst case to store all vertices of the graph. When the graph is too large to traverse for result, it is commonly to set depth limit for DFS to avoid overuse of memory or disk spaces.\nBacktracking\nBacktracking is a technique to find all solutions to a specified computation problem, e.g. a classic problem as to find all arrangements of eight queens in a chess board that all of queens can not attack each other.\nRecursive as it is, backtracking incrementally builds the candidate solution pieces to the final solution and abandon partial candidates (backtracking) along the way. In other words, the procedure can be seen as traversing in a search tree structure with backtracking between two node levels time to time:\n\n  \n  Figure 3. An Example of Backtracking problem Search Tree\n\n\nIn a possible recursion rule, the solution candidates will go from {Root, A}, {Root, A, C}, {Root, A, D}, {Root}, {Root, B}, {Root, B, E} to arrive at the final solution. Obviously, the backtracking approach would outperform the brute-force search method by memoizing partial solution to the final one.\nAdditional References\n\nWikibooks Bidirectional Search: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence/Search/Heuristic_search/Bidirectional_Search\n\n"},"searching/hash-table.html":{"url":"searching/hash-table.html","title":"Hash Table","keywords":"","body":"Hash Table\nThis section concerns Hash Table data structure and its relevant hash functions designs.

It is a poor choice in the context of Internet data size. Thus, the Hash Table is introduced.\nDesign Idea\nHash Table is an extended array structure that associate keys with values that is dynamically resizable on demand. It is designed to combine the good qualities of List) and Array data structures.\nSuppose given an evolving set 풮 from global universe 풰.\n\nList) only requires Θ(|풮|) space but lookup time Θ(|풮|) as well.\nArray only requires Ο(1) for lookup time but Θ(|풰|) space.\n\nHash Table possesses both the small space of storage Ο(|풮|) and swift entry access of Ο(1) optimally.\nIn order to support three distinct operations of Hash Table: INSERTION of new record, DELETE existing record and LOOKUP for a specified record, Hash Table is built in several steps:\n\ndecide a n that is the number of \"buckets\" for storing entries; (might be dynamically extensible if |풮| is variant).\n\nchoose a hash function 풽: 풰 → {0,1,2, .., n-1}\n\nstore entry 퓍 in array A[풽(퓍)]\n\n\nNote: if the record does not exist, INSERTION of new entries will complete but DELETE will fail; if the record exists, INSERTION of new entries will override the existing values and DELETE will succeed.\nWhat if the \"bucket\" location has already been occupied when trying to insert a new entry? In other words, a hash collision happens. Generally, there are two approaches, (separate) chaining and open-addressing, in resolving this situation.\nHash Collision\nNote: hash collision always happens, there is never a \"perfect\" hash function ever discovered to have no collisions during entry insertion.\nLoad Factor\nDefine a load factor (α) as a hashing performance metric for hash table Τ:\nα = n / m, where n is the total number of elements, m is the number of buckets in hash table for storing elements. The value of α can vary as bigger than 1, equal to 1 and less than 1; when α is far larger than 1, the hash table is hence overloaded and need to expand itself by the techniques introduced in table doubling.\nThe average-case performance of hashing depends on how well the 풽 function distribute n keys in m slots. Hence, assuming that bucket position each element is hashed into is independent with each other and equally likely any of m slots would be chosen as the bucket, then\nsimple uniform hashing:\nFor ј = 0, 1, ..., m-1, let's denote the length of the list Τ[ј] by nј, so that n = n0 + n1 + .. + nm-1. The expected value of nј is E[nj] = α = n/m.\nAnd the following content provides practices on the basis of such term.\n(Separate) Chaining\nIn chaining method, all entries with same hash values are chained together in a LinkedList; Specifically, either a pointer exists in a bucket of the hash table which points to the LinkedList (Singly or Doubly Linked list) of all entries hashed to that bucket, or there is only a NIL in that bucket.\nLOOKUP costs Θ(1 + α) in chaining version of Hash Table. INSERTION operation in this structure takes worst-case running time of Ο(1), while the DELETION might takes up to Ο(n) if all entries hashed into one bucket; if using the doubly LinkedList, DELETION may speed up.\nOpen Addressing\nAlthough it is possible for (separate) chaining method to have number of buckets smaller than the total number of elements to store, open addressing must be kept with enough extra spaces in hash table buckets (m ⩾ n, α ⩽ 1).\nIn other words, all elements are stored in buckets and one entry per bucket. While it is possible for such hash table to fill up the entire buckets, open addressing method saves memory occupation by pointers to allocate more buckets, drastically minimizing hash collisions and improving searching speed.\nIn order to INSERT element into the hash table, open addressing requires continuous buckets examinations, which is termed probe, until an empty bucket is located;\nprobe sequence: to make INSERTION operation successful, for each key k, there is a length m probe sequence:\n\nwherein each hash function generates a distinct position within the range of buckets. There are three major probing techniques in which probe sequence is produced in different manners.\nNote: when performing DELETE operation, the designated entry should be labeled \"deleted\" in case of further DELETE operation failure. (e.g. k2 is inserted after probing the location of k1, if k1 is deleted to recover an empty bucket, there is no way to know beforehand whether k2 has been inserted. Then, the further SEARCH and DELETE operation of k2 will fail)\n\nLinear Probing\n\nGiven an auxiliary hash function 풽': 풰 -> {0, 1, ..., m-1}, then linear probing would use:\n풽(k, i) = (풽'(k) + i) mod m\nthat before INSERTION, first probing the bucket Τ[풽'(k)], and Τ[풽'(k) + 1],... till the Τ[풽'(k) - 1]; to be noted that the initial probing position determines the entire possible sequence.\n\nQuadratic Probing\n\nUnder the same premise of linear probing, quadratic probing adopts a better strategy:\n풽(k, i) = (풽'(k) + 풸1 ⋅ i + 풸2 ⋅ i2) mod m\nwherein 풸1 and 풸2 are positive constants, i = 0, 1, ..., m-1\ninstead of occupying large portions of adjacent buckets by using linear probing, quadratic probing leads to a more dispersed distribution of elements.\n\nDouble Hashing\n\nThis is known as the best strategy of the three in open addressing method;\n풽(k, i) = (풽1(k) + i ⋅ 풽2(k)) mod m\nwhere in both 풽1 and 풽2 are auxiliary hash functions; in order to search the whole hash table, value of 풽2 has to be relatively prime to the hash table size m. And it results in a Θ(m2) of probing sequence for each key k, approximating the optimal simple uniform hashing that for each key there is m! number of probe sequence permutations.\n\nHash Function\nWhat makes a \"good\" hash function? it should have properties of spreading data out uniformly in the hash table and simple to compute and evaluate.\nA common practice in hash function is to transform the universe of keys into natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} and process such numbers to construct the hash function.\nIn designing the hash function 풽 against key k, there are genuinely three methods in which first two are heuristic while the last one is an randomized technique.\nDivision Method\nBy taking modular arithmetic in the following form, the key _k_is hashed into one of m buckets of the hash table:\n풽(k) = k mod m, where m ≠ 2p, p is natural number.\nNote: it is wise to choose a prime number as the value of m, this method is practical but inconvenient to find a prime number.\nMultiplication Method\nThere are four steps to construct a multiplication hashing method:\n\nmultiply k with a constant A (0 A w in terms of word length)\nextract the decimal part of the previous result.\nmultiply m with the previous result.\nround down to an integer and obtain the hash value.\n\n풽(k) = ⌊ m ⋅ (_k_A mod 1) ⌋\nGenerally, this method outperforms the division method. If m is a power of 2, it is easier to compute the hash simply by shifting bits.\n\n  \n  Figure 2. Multiplication Hashing Method\n\n\nUniversal Hashing\n(this section is not yet covered)\nTable Doubling\nWhen the number of elements exceeds the number of buckets (assume chaining is not used), the hash table needs to grow its size to not slow down the access speed. Similar as when the number of elements are far less than the number of buckets, the hash table needs to shrink its size to save memory space.\nThe goal is to make sure Θ(n) = m whenever the table shrinks or grows. Then, how fast should it grow and shrink?\nSuppose it grows from m to m+1, which means there is rebuild of hash table in every step of insertion, in total: Θ(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = Θ(n2), not good.\nWhat about grow it to its double size? e.g. m to 2m, which means there is only rebuild of hash table in 2ith step (i is the number of insertion operation), in total: Θ(1 + 2 + 4 + ... + n) = Θ(n) (n is a power of 2). There are few inserts cause linear time to rebuild the hash table while the overall average time would be Θ(1) (see amortized analysis)\nFor table shrinkage, if applying the similar rule to shrink the table size to its half, there will have problems when the n exceeds m by 1 then delete that new element (first double the table size then resize to original). Therefore, in order to avoid that frequent memory modification pattern, the table will shrink to half its size when n = m / 4\n\nExamples\nVarious programming problems borrow solutions from Hash Table implementations to increase productivity.\nDe-Duplication\nGiven a stream of objects, say real time data from WEB, the goal is to remove duplicates and to keep track of unique object occurrence.\nIf a new object arrives, check if it exists in current hash table, insert it if not present even with same hash key and drop it otherwise.\nIt is applicable in scenarios such as reporting unique visitors to website or avoid repeated searching results by end users.\n\nThe 2-SUM Problem\nGiven an unsorted array A of n integers and a target sum t, determine whether or not there are two numbers x, y in A with x + y = t.\nA naive solution may be to use exhaustive search in two encapsulated loops of Θ(n2). And to improve slightly upon that, applying a comparison-based sort such as MergeSort piggybacking a binary-search for t - x given every x would have a Θ(n ⋅ log n) complexity.\nOverall, a killer solution is by using the concept of Hash Table. Insert values of A into a hash table and for each value x in the table, search the t - x in Θ(n) time.\n\nJava 8 HashMap\n\nreference:\nhttp://www.nagarro.com/de/perspectives/post/24/performance-improvement-for-hashmap-in-java-8\n\nHash collisions in hash table data structures have significant impact on performance of LOOKUP operation as to increase the worst-case running time from Ο(1) to Ο(n).\nTo improve upon that, Java8 spec of HashMap implementations requires the buckets containing colliding keys should store entries in a balanced tree instead of linked list. Hence, the searching operation takes no more than Ο(log(n)) in general.\nReferences\n\nGoogle Security Blog - Announcing the first SHA1 collision, 2017.\nHash tables and amortized analysis - CS 312 Lecture 20, Cornell, 2008.\n\n"},"searching/string-matching.html":{"url":"searching/string-matching.html","title":"String Search","keywords":"","body":"String Matching\nGiven a text string T and a pattern P (a substring, a character or a Regular Expression), which are both in the defined character set ∑, find some/all occurrences of P within T is termed the task of string matching.\nThere are multiple string-matching applications in computing such as the popular grep UNIX tool in finding patterns within data sets.\nGenerally, there are two kinds of techniques in string matching tasks:\n\none-shot algorithmic approach: Ο(T) time in average, examples include KMP algorithm, Rabin-Karp algorithm.\n\nstatic data structures approach: preprocess string T and optimally obtain a Ο(P) time and Ο(T) space.\n\n\nOne-shot Approach\nObviously, algorithmic solutions that needs nearly no preprocessing are categorized as one-shot. There are various methods trying to improve upon the naive string match such as Rabin-Karp algorithm and KMP algorithm.\nNaive String Match\nA naive algorithm would be built under a principle of \"brute-force\" search that beginning from each character occurrence of target strings (t), find whether the source string (s) matches a successive portion of target strings (t).\nNAIVE_STRING_MATCH(s, t)\n  for i in range length(t) - length(s)\n    if s = t.substring(i, i+length(s))\n      return true\n  return false\nIt takes Ο(|s|) for each substring comparison and the total number of comparison is Ο(|t| - |s|), then\nΤ(n) = Ο(|s| ⋅ |t|) ≈ quadratic time\nRabin-Karp Algorithm\nRabin-Karp or Karp-Rabin algorithm, is a string searching primitive that uses hashing technique. Specifically, it requires to compare a hash value for the pattern with distinct hashes of the sub-text in the target string.\nIf hash computations are performed each time on sub-text, the overall complexity is even higher than the naive string match. Therefore, a rolling hash technique is introduced. The design of such hash function varies in different scenarios to provide a reasonable computation complexity and some magnitude of randomness. In the following discussions, it is assumed the hash function 풽 satisfies the simple uniform hashing.\nRolling Hash\nA rolling hash is a hash function that process inputs within a sliding window, it is powerful to rapidly calculate the hash value for the new entry without having to rehash it.\nGiven a string ABCDBBCA and a pattern BCDB; compute the hash value of pattern 풽(BCDB) and the first sub-text in the string 풽(ABCD), the result does not match, thus slide the window right by 1 slot; generate the new hash value 풽(BCDB) by rolling hash (append a character B to the end of old hash value and skip the tail character value A from the old hash value); the new results have a match, procedure ends.\n\n  \n  Figure 1. Rolling Hash Example\n\n\nRABIN_KARP(s, t)\n  hs := hash(s)\n  ht := hash(t[1..length(s)])\n  for i in range length(t) - length(s)\n    if hs = ht\n      return true\n    else\n      ht := ht.append(t[length(s) + i])\n      ht := ht.skip(i)\n  return false\nSince the hash function processes the The expected running time for Rabin-Karp algorithm in string matching is Ο(|s| + (|t| - |s|) ⋅ cost(풽)); In the naive version of hashing, the cost of 풽 will be persistent as |s|, the overall complexity would be Ο(|t| ⋅ |s|) ≈ quadratic time. By adopting rolling hash, the cost of hash function could be reduced down to Ο(1), thus time complexity for Rabin-Karp algorithm is Ο(|t|) ≈ linear time\nKnuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm\n(this section is not yet covered)\nStatic Data Structures\nIn the context of massive dataset of WEB, preprocessing before performing searching or statistical operations is necessary to reduce the time complexity, even demanding in the real-time systems.\nTries\nA trie, also called radix tree or prefix tree, as the name suggests, is a tree-alike data structure for searching primitives (trie comes from the word retrieval). It sacrifices memory space in exchange of better searching performance and it satisfies the following properties:\n\nthe root of trie contains NULL entries.\nstrings with same prefixes share the common ancestors in the trie.\nthe root-to-leaf path represents the entire string and terminated with a special character $ that is not in the set ∑.\n\nSpecifically, given an input: {an, ana, ann, anna, anne}, constructing a trie:\n\n  \n  Figure 1. Trie Representation in a Tree\n\n\nNote: there are some denotations mark the edges as characters instead of nodes, which conveys the same meaning.\nSince the generation of a trie is one-pass and remain static afterwards, it is wise to contract some of the adjacent edges (nodes) which have a single descendent to one edge (node) for searching simplicity. Then, a compressed trie would look like:\n\n  \n  Figure 2. Compressed Trie\n\n\nNote: it is valid to contract the termination character ($) to the final character node, the version provided here only assists comprehension.\nRoughly, query strings in the Trie cost Ο(P) in time (LOOKUP time is independent of the number of strings in the trie!) and Ο(T) in space; Nonetheless, there are slight variations among different data representations, if you are interested, check here.\nNote: if the character set is ASCII based, it is recommended to use static data structures such as array (e.g. array[1..128]) to store children of a node instead of a dynamic structure like list (which costs linear time than constant to search for the prefixes and the cost of querying strings exceeds Ο(P)).\n\nApplications\n\nIn the world of Internet, Trie has numerous useful applications. For instance, the autocomplete feature of search box in various websites such as Google, can be embedded with a Trie data structure whenever you type in a letter, the Trie gets pruned and greatly increase the speed of next search.\nIt is common that misspelled words share similar prefixes as the correct words, and Trie can be helpful in performing string matching algorithm in this context of spell check.\nSuffix Trie\nNormally, suffix trie is also called suffix tree and as the name suggests, it stores the suffixes of a string in ways compressed trie store prefixes. The difference between a compressed trie and a suffix trie is that suffix trie uses all suffixes of a single string which is appended with a $ and a trie terminates a bunch of strings with $.\nFor instance, given a string \"banana\" and build a suffix trie for that, first a $ has to be appended to the end of the string, namely \"banana$\"; then list all its suffixes \"banana$\", \"anana$\", \"nana$\", \"ana$\", \"na$\", \"a$\" and \"$\"; finally, prefix them in a trie structure to obtain the suffix tree:\n\n  \n  Figure 3. Suffix Trie Representation\n\n\n\nApplications\n\nThere are many practical uses of Suffix Trees such as Longest Common Substring problem, Genomic projects, etc. It is worth noted Suffix Tree is not practical in single searches since preprocess the given text requires a large amount of time.\nAdditional References\n\nWhat is a rolling hash and when is it useful? https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-rolling-hash-and-when-is-it-useful\n\nSuffix Trees, HackerEarth. https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/suffix-trees/tutorial/\n\nApplications of Suffix Trees https://web.stanford.edu/~mjkay/Maass.pdf\n\n\n"},"dynamic-programming/overview.html":{"url":"dynamic-programming/overview.html","title":"Dynamic Programming","keywords":"","body":"Dynamic Programming\nIn the fields of computer science, economics, managerial sciences, mathematics and bioinformatics, dynamic programming or dynamic optimization is similar to divide-and-conquer principle as to decompose a complex problem into smaller sub-problems.\nFundamental Idea\nIn contrast to the paradigm of DnC that sub-problems are independent, dynamic programming is adopted to solve interleaved sub-problems wherein multiple sub-problems might have common smaller sub-problems. And for each repetitive sub-problem, dynamic programming would store and reuse the solution when it was solved the first time (also known as memoization), programming solutions all together.\nThe typical dynamic programming algorithm is developed in steps follow:\n\nCharacterize the optimal sub-structures along with possible moves.\nDefine the recurrence relations of sub-problems.\nCompute recursively or iteratively in a bottom-up fashion or top-down with memoization fashion.\nConstruct an overall optimal solution or combining solutions of sub-problems.\n\nNoted that the word programming does not stand for computer programming but a tabulation method that was invented by R.

Both are adopted in favor of tackling optimization problem, and dynamic programming seeks and combines the previous solutions for sub-problems to yield the final result while greedy algorithms chooses locally optimal solution in each run and not guarantee to have the optimal result.\nFor instance, in a coin change problem of finding a minimum number of coins with certain denominations added up to a specified amount, dynamic programming is a killer solution than using greedy algorithms in that:\ngiven a set of denominations: 1, 4, 5, 15, 20 and the specified amount 23; the dynamic programming would yield an optimal solution of 15 + 4 + 4 while the greedy algorithms offers a non-optimal one 20 + 1 + 1 + 1.\nwherein, greedy algorithms picks the largest one in the set of coins from the first run; dynamic programming takes into account the solutions to each small sub-problem that are related to each other during iterations.\nTable of Contents\nThe following example questions can be categorized into dynamic programming type:\n\nFibonacci Numbers - a topic referring to Fibonacci sequence that to find a ith such number.\nMatrix-Chain Multiplication - solving the matrix dot multiplication in an most efficient way by least number of scalar multiplications in total.\nLCS Problem - a practical problem found in many scenarios such as DNA sequences detection.\nDiscrete Knapsack - knapsack problem in a discrete version.\n\n"},"greedy-algorithms/overview.html":{"url":"greedy-algorithms/overview.html","title":"Greedy Algorithms","keywords":"","body":"Greedy Algorithms\nUsing dynamic programming in most of the scenarios could be an overkill for optimization problems.

Each activity has a starting time si and a ending time fi. If two activities have no overlapping time frames then they are compatible, and a maximal compatible set of activities is required to compute at the end.\nIt is reasonable to solve this problem using dynamic programming approach with optimal substructure and solution scheme. However, there is an easy way to conquer this problem using greedy approach.\nIntuitively, an activity is chosen that ends the first and spare as much time as possible for the rest of activities (there might be other greedy approaches, this only serves as an example).
